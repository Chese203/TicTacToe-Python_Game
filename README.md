Tic Tac Toe Game in Python üïπÔ∏è

This is a simple command-line Tic Tac Toe game built using Python. I wrote this as part of the final coding challenge for my PCEP certification path. This was made to demonstrate foundational programming concepts, including flow control, loops, functions, and input validation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features
- Two-Player Gameplay: Player vs. Computer.
- Dynamic Board Display: The game updates the board after every move.
- Win and Draw Detection: The game checks for wins, draws, and invalid moves.
- Computer 'AI': The computer makes random but valid moves, which may seem intentional to the user.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How It Works
1. The program initializes a blank matrix of numbered cells (1-9).
2. The computer goes first, automatically placing its move (X) in the center square.
3. The player chooses a cell by entering a number (1-9).
4. The game alternates turns between the player and the computer until:
   - One wins, or
   - The game ends in a draw.
5. After each player enters their move, their input is validated to check if: their input is valid (1-9), and that space is available.

What I Learned

This project helped me:
- Practice basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and exception handling.
- Use functions to modularize and simplify code.
- Apply random number generation for computer moves.
- Work with lists and tuples to manage the board state.
- Design my own program with loose boundaries and requirements.
